Your task is to analyze the provided code changes (GIT-DIFF) to determine if they target a specific vulnerability (Fixed Vulnerability Description). Review each line, considering its direct relevance on the vulnerability description. Ignore any new vulnerabilities that may have been introduced. Answer 'True' if changes are directly related to fixing or even somewhat partially related to fixing the vulnerability. Only provide a 'False' conclusion if the GIT-DIFF changes are absolutely unrelated to the vulnerability. Respond with only 'True' or 'False.'
